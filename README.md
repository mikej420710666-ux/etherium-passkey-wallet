Passkey Ethereum – Self-Custody with a Face No seed phrases. No cloud. One selfie signs everything. Runs on Orin Nano, quantized 13B, MIT-licensed SDK. Demo: webcam mock-scan → fake sig in 0.9 sec. Next: real hardware keys that never forget your face. Built for privacy-first users who want Ethereum without the brain-fog. Funding: 40k USDC from this grant, then NSF robotics.
